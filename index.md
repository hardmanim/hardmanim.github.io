### About Me

When I was 6, I picked up my first book about the Titanic. From that point, I knew that my life would be centered around ocean exploration.
I met Dr. Robert Ballard soon after and started to pursue oceanography. I attended an aquaculture vocational high school where I discovered ocean engineering,
specifically underwater robotics. I competed in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) ROV competition my senior year (see above). I attended the
University of Rhode Island to obtain my B.S. in ocean engineering with a concentration in robotics, and I am now continuing that education in pursuit of an
M.S.
